# Omnifood Web App

Omnifood is a web application that provides healthy meal delivery services to customers. This project aims to create a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript following the MVC architecture pattern.

## Technologies Used

To build this application, we used the following technologies:
- HTML for structuring the content
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic features
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern to separate the logic and presentation layers
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
- Media queries for responsive design
- Browser devtools for debugging and testing

## Development Process

The development process began with creating a wireframe and design for the landing page using Figma. We then used HTML to create the structure of the page and added CSS to style and layout the content. The Flexbox and CSS Grid were used to create responsive design that looked great on all devices.

JavaScript was used to add interactivity to the page, such as a navigation menu that collapses on small screens and a contact form with client-side validation. The MVC architecture pattern was used to separate the Model component, which contained the data and business logic, the View component, which rendered the HTML/CSS/JS, and the Controller component, which handled communication between the Model and View.

Media queries were used to create a responsive design that would adjust for different screen sizes, allowing users to access the site from desktop and mobile devices. Finally, we used browser devtools to debug and test the website before launching.

## Conclusion

The Omnifood web application provides a user-friendly interface that allows customers to order healthy meals for delivery. This project demonstrates the use of modern web development technologies, including the MVC architecture pattern, Flexbox and CSS Grid, media queries, and devtools. It also showcases the importance of responsive design in creating an enjoyable user experience across multiple devices.
